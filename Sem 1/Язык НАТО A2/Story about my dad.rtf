\f0\fs48 \cf0 My dad was born on September 3, 1970, in Ukraine, in the village of Podmikhailo in the Ivano-Fronkov region. He was engaged in wrestling and won almost all city competitions, but when he was 16, he decided that he would be a doctor and when he finished school he went to St. Petersburg to enroll as a doctor in the medical university named after Mechnikov. This was in 1986, when the USSR still existed and education was free. He was able to go to university, and 6 years later, as soon as my father finished his residency, he met my mother, who was only a second-year student at the same university. A year later they got married, and some time later my older brother Pasha was born (June 13, 1996). Then my middle brother Petya (January 1, 2001) and me (October 17, 2003) were born. After graduation, Dad started to work as a resuscitator and part-time translator of medical articles from Polish into Russian, as he was fluent in it. Today he is the head of the intensive care unit at the hospital of the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg.}
