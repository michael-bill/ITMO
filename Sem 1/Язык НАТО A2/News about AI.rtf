\f0\fs74 \cf0 The Chinese government are introducing mandatory labeling for any digital products that are created by artificial intelligence like text, images, audio and another content. China\'92s leaders believe that AI can be used to spread illegal information, defamation and identity spoofing, and labeling will help avoid this. The new requirements will take effect January 10, 2023.\
Many artists on digital platforms have already begun to protest against artificial intelligence. Since the differences between the paintings of artists and paintings of AI are minimal.
