Hello! My name is Misha. I am a second year student at ITMO University, studying at faculty of Software Engineering and Computer Science.

I am originally from the city of St. Petersburg and still live here. I’m staying here and I don’t want to leave to anothet city, because my family and friends are here.

Every day I study, because studying at my university is very difficult and takes a lot of time. I also try to exercise and relax in the evening to feel good during such intensive studying.

I really like studying at my university, even though it is difficult, I understand that in the future I can become a very cool specialist in my field.

For example, yesterday I had to prepare for two tests (for english and probability theory), also for very difficult test on web programming for 30 tickets. It's the beginning of the session and there's a lot of tests :(

Thanks for reading my blog, I hope you found it interesting. :)
